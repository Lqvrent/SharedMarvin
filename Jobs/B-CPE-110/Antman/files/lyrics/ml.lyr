To say it's love would be too simple
Too obvious
It's more like a calling, a vocation
Something I was
Put on this earth to do
Now I'm shooting with the stars
And I'm flying with the angels
And my heartbeat is a symphony the
Closer I get to you
I never saw you comin' till you
Came and here you are
I never thought someone
Would ever dare
To come this far
You're up for the resistance
And I'm strong in my persistence
And I've never known
A remedy like ours
If I can't have you
If I can't have you
I would be a river dried up
Into dust
I would be imprisoned
For ever having loved
If I can't have you
I don't wanna be me
Then I would be the same man
You scraped off the ground
I'd have to go back bein'
That broken soul you found
Those days are in the darkness
I buried them with hardness
And I'd have to dig those
Demons out
Your life is like anchor that puts
Me in my place
No you won't let me sink when
I'm off losin' my way
Thank God for your virtue
And the wisdom in your eye
Cause somehow you
Get through on
All that crazy in my mind
If I can't have you
If I can't have you
I would be a river
Dried up into dust
I would be imprisoned for never
Having loved
If I can't have you
I don't wanna be me
I don't wanna be me
Why did it take you so long to
Finally see
That we had love
That you don't find easily
You broke my heart and the price
To pay for that
Is you'll have to live the misery of
Losing what you had
If I can't have you
My words have come to late
I've already turned that page
Don't you look at me back and
That's the part I hate
I'll stay trapped inside my hell
Where it's so hot
That my walls melt
And I can hear a promise
In every lie you said
You'd never tell
If I had only told the truth
Oh I could never trust you to
You'll survive
No I will die
If I can't have you
If I can't have you
Then I'm sorry for the things I
Cost you in the end
My punishment is more than any
Man can stand
I need you in my life
I can't let go
Why don't you stay with me
Tonight
I feel alone
Turn off all the lights
Take me home
If I can't have you
If I can't have you
Then I would be a river
Dried up into dust
I would be imprisoned
For ever having loved
If I can't have you
I don't wanna be me
To say it's love would be too simple
