🎶 Sometimes my life is like an 🌊
And I feel like I'm just going through the motions
My 🤯 is 🏎️ down a 🛣️
I don't know where I'm going, but it's my way 🎶

🎶 That's when I 🛑 trippin'
💭 'bout what I'm missing
I feel so 👍 I might just 🗣️ it again
Just wanna 🛑 trippin'
Thinking 'bout what I'm missing
I feel so 👍 I might just, I might just, I might just 🎶

🎶 Sing 📴 🔑
🕺 with 2️ left 👣
Won't let nobody
Take my 😀 from me
Not a care in the air

To the 🥁, 🥁, 🥁
It's 👍 vibrations 🎶

🎶 Da, da
Da, da, da
Da, da
It's 👍 vibrations 🎶

🎶 I feel so breezy when I'm coastin'
When I want to get away from my emotions
I live my life like no one's 👀
Find myself in a 🌎 I felt so lost in 🎶

🎶 That's when I 🛑 trippin'
Thinking 'bout what I'm missing
I feel so 👍 I might just say it again
Just wanna 🛑 trippin'
Thinking 'bout what I'm missing
I feel so 👍 I might just, I might just, I might just 🎶
